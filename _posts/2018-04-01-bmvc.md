We are co-organizing the <a href="http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/workshop_2018/">4th International Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose</a> at <a href="https://eccv2018.org/">ECCV 2018</a>, which will be held in Munich.

In this workshop, people working on relevant topics in both industry and academia will share up-to-date advances and identify open problems. 

The workshop will feature several high-quality invited talks, presentations of accepted papers and a challenge on 6D object pose estimation from RGB/RGB-D images.
