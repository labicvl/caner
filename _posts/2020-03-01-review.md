Our recent paper on object pose recovery accepted to the journal of Image and Vision Computing. In this study, we present a comprehensive and timely survey of the recent literature on object pose estimation, reviewing the methods from 3D bounding box detectors to full 6D pose estimators.

Our paper is now available online: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2020.103898">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.imavis.2020.103898</a>
