Our team, as a party of the organizers, successfully hosted the <a href="http://cmp.felk.cvut.cz/sixd/workshop_2017/">3rd International Workshop on Recovering 6D Object Pose</a>, in ICCV17, Venice.

The workshop featured several high-quality invited talks, presentations of accepted papers, a panel discussion to identify open problems, and a challenge with the goal of establishing the state of the art in 6D object pose estimation from RGB or RGB-D images.
